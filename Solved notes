here are some questions:

now, by saving and XML file without verification I'm able to delete both flows and flowNodes, the problem is that I can delete them only from a process point of view. I cannot delete them from the bpmndi (the methods simply does not exist).

I assume that the model could be executed by a machine without encountering problems (in fact i can even open them in camunda), but the bpmndi creates issues when saving the file because it contains references to items that don't exist anymore.

I would suggest I create some methods to edit the bpmdi directly in XML form.
To do so I have two options:
	
	everytime I delete an element I extract the xml form of my inputModel, i edit it as an xml (only the bpmdi part), and then I reopen it again as a BpmnModelInstance.

	or

	i create an array of all the ID's of the element that I want to delete, and right before I save the XML I call a method that deletes all of them.
	This solution seems more 'elegant' but it's also less general (what If I want to do something different rather than just deleting stuff? But maybe I will never need it).


Another major doubt that I have is:  "what if I create a new element from zero, instead of deleting it? The BPMDI information for that element would never exist."
(I haven't tried it yet, but I have tried "deleting" the information of an element from the bpmndi of an xml)
If I were to create a bpmndi block for it from scratch, I could try to deduce that element's ideal position from it's neighbors.

problema Ã¨ che certe volte aggiungono _di alla fine dell'id, altre volte no. Bisogna capire quando. Oppure bisogna semplicemente dirgli di eliminarli entrambi.
